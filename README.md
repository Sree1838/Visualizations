# Visualizations
Seaborn Visualizations

I have used HR Analytics data.

The data consists of the employees' department, age,gender,awardswon,length of service etc having is_promoted feature.

I have used some of the plots and drawn some of the conclusions.

-> countplot with percentage of each feature.

-> pairplot

-> jointplot

-> heatmap
